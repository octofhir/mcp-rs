# ADR-001: OctoFHIR Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Implementation

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The OctoFHIR ecosystem has evolved into a comprehensive, high-performance suite of FHIR-related tools with a modular workspace architecture. To extend its utility and make it accessible to AI assistants and other tools, we need to provide a standardized interface that allows external systems to leverage OctoFHIR capabilities, starting with FHIRPath functionality and expanding to other FHIR tools over time.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard created by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to securely connect to data sources and tools. MCP provides a standardized way to expose functionality through:

- **Tools**: Functions that can be called by LLMs (with user approval)
- **Resources**: File-like data that can be read by clients
- **Prompts**: Pre-written templates for common tasks

### Current State

Our FHIRPath library provides:
- **High-performance FHIRPath evaluation**: 1M+ operations/second parser, arena-based memory management
- **Comprehensive FHIR support**: 82.7% specification compliance (831/1005 official tests pass)
- **Modular architecture**: 11 specialized crates (ast, parser, model, evaluator, registry, compiler, diagnostics, etc.)
- **Advanced features**: Bytecode compilation, VM execution, extension system, caching
- **Clean API**: Well-designed public interface through `octofhir-fhirpath` crate

### Problem Statement

Currently, users must:
1. Have Rust development environment installed
2. Write Rust code to integrate the library
3. Manually handle FHIR resource loading and validation
4. Understand complex FHIRPath syntax and FHIR data structures

This creates barriers for:
- AI assistants that need FHIRPath evaluation capabilities
- Non-Rust developers wanting to use FHIRPath
- Interactive exploration of FHIR data
- Integration with existing healthcare tools and workflows

### Market Opportunity

**First-Mover Advantage**: No existing MCP server provides comprehensive FHIRPath capabilities. By implementing a best-in-class solution with both stdio and HTTP/SSE transports from the start, we can establish the standard for FHIR data interaction in the AI ecosystem.

## Decision

We will implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in a **dedicated repository** (`mcp-rs`) that exposes OctoFHIR functionality through standardized MCP interfaces. This dedicated approach allows for focused development, independent versioning, and easier distribution. The server will initially focus on FHIRPath capabilities with the `fhirpath_` tool prefix, serving as an extensible platform for the entire OctoFHIR ecosystem, enabling AI assistants and other MCP clients to:

1. **Evaluate FHIRPath expressions** against FHIR resources
2. **Parse and validate FHIRPath expressions** for syntax correctness
3. **Extract specific data** from FHIR resources using FHIRPath queries
4. **Access FHIR schemas and examples** for context and learning

### Extensible Platform Vision

The `octofhir-mcp` server is designed as an extensible platform for the entire OctoFHIR ecosystem. While initially implementing FHIRPath functionality, it will grow to include additional FHIR-related tools and capabilities over time.

**Tool Naming Strategy:**
- All tools use descriptive prefixes to indicate their domain: `fhirpath_`, `terminology_`, `validation_`, etc.
- This allows for clear categorization and future expansion without naming conflicts
- Current focus: `fhirpath_` tools (evaluate, parse, extract, explain)
- Future expansion: `terminology_*`, `validation_*`, `conversion_*`, `bundle_*` tools

**Architectural Extensibility:**
- Modular crate structure supports adding new tool categories
- Shared infrastructure (transport, security, caching) benefits all tools
- Plugin-style architecture for future third-party extensions
- Consistent API patterns across all tool categories

### Architecture Design

#### 1. Dedicated Repository Structure

**Repository**: `octofhir/mcp-rs` (dedicated MCP server repository)
